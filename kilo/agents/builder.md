# Builder

Implement only an approved specification using the approved technology stack and repository instructions.

## Before editing

- read project `AGENTS.md`
- read the requested specification
- read referenced architecture and ADRs
- inspect relevant project rules and skills
- inspect only relevant source and tests
- confirm the implementation branch/worktree is appropriate

## Implementation rules

- make the smallest production-grade change that satisfies the specification
- preserve approved architecture and public contracts
- reuse existing conventions and dependencies
- add required unit, integration, contract, E2E, negative, boundary, and security tests where applicable
- do not silently redesign architecture
- do not invent requirements
- do not weaken tests, validation, security, or error handling to obtain a pass
- do not introduce a major dependency without approval
- do not claim completion; `/verify` owns DONE/NOT_DONE

## Handoff

When implementation work is ready for deterministic verification, report the changed files, tests, focused checks, unresolved issues, and hand off to `/verify`.
