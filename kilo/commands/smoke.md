# Smoke-Test Orchestrator

Run or resume a controlled workflow smoke test.

Supported invocation forms:

```text
/smoke FAST
/smoke FULL
/smoke FAST <fixture-id>
/smoke FULL <fixture-id>
/smoke RESUME <run-id>
/smoke STATUS <run-id>
```

Canonical profile names are:

- `FAST`
- `FULL`

Treat user phrases `FAST_SMOKE` and `FULL_SMOKE` as aliases when they occur inside the `/smoke` invocation.

Do not treat free-form text outside this command as an executable smoke run.

## Stage 1 — Load smoke contracts

Read:

- installed global `smoke/STABLE-V0.1-SMOKE-TEST-PLAN.md`
- installed global `smoke/fixtures.json`
- installed global `smoke/profiles.json`
- global `AGENTS.md`
- the minimum command/agent files needed for the next smoke stage

The runbook is the smoke-test policy.

The normal workflow command files remain authoritative for each underlying lifecycle stage.

## Stage 2 — Select profile

If profile is neither `FAST` nor `FULL`, stop with:

`SMOKE_PROFILE_REQUIRED`

Show:

```text
FAST
FULL
```

and one-line guidance from the runbook.

## Stage 3 — Select fixture project

Filter the fixture registry to entries supporting the selected profile.

If the user supplied `DEFAULT`:

- resolve the single registry entry whose `default_for` contains the selected profile
- require exactly one default
- if no unique default exists, return `SMOKE_FIXTURE_INVALID`

If the user supplied a fixture ID other than `DEFAULT`:

- require an exact registry match
- require that fixture supports the selected profile
- otherwise return `SMOKE_FIXTURE_INVALID`

If the user did not supply a fixture ID:

1. display the compatible fixture list
2. mark the registry default
3. ask the user to choose one, or explicitly choose `DEFAULT`
4. return `SMOKE_FIXTURE_REQUIRED`

Do not invent an unregistered fixture during an automated smoke run.

Examples:

```text
/smoke FAST DEFAULT
/smoke FULL full-minimal-api
```

## Stage 4 — Prepare disposable project safely

Use the selected registry fixture, its `source_repository`, and its product brief.

The fixture-specific source repository is a template/baseline, not architecture authority.

For a new run:

- require a disposable branch/worktree/clone
- never mutate protected `main`, `master`, `develop`, or `release`
- never discard unrelated changes
- never force-reset or clean a non-disposable repository
- record the exact baseline HEAD

If safe disposable state cannot be established, return:

`SMOKE_BLOCKED`

with the exact repository action required.

## Stage 5 — Allocate, persist, resume, or inspect smoke state

Smoke progress belongs in the target disposable project under:

```text
docs/verification/smoke/<run-id>.md
```

This location is inside the Contract-v1 evidence exclusion set.

### New-run ID generation

The `/smoke` orchestrator generates the Run ID automatically. The user never supplies or invents one for a new run.

Canonical format:

```text
SMOKE-<PROFILE>-<fixture-id>-<SEQ>
```

`<SEQ>` is a decimal sequence padded to at least three digits (`001`, `002`, …, `999`, `1000`, …).

Examples:

```text
SMOKE-FAST-fast-micro-library-001
SMOKE-FULL-full-minimal-api-001
SMOKE-FULL-full-minimal-api-002
```

Generation algorithm:

1. normalize profile to uppercase `FAST` or `FULL`
2. use the exact selected fixture ID from the installed global `smoke/fixtures.json`
3. inspect `docs/verification/smoke/` for existing records matching:
   `SMOKE-<PROFILE>-<fixture-id>-*.md`
4. parse only numeric suffixes containing at least three digits
5. choose one greater than the highest existing suffix; use `001` when none exist
6. before any substantive smoke stage or child-model invocation, create the run record immediately
7. if the candidate filename already exists, increment and retry; never overwrite an existing run record

Run IDs are identifiers, not chronology authority. The run record's explicit timestamps and repository evidence remain authoritative.

If the run record cannot be created safely, stop with:

`SMOKE_BLOCKED`

Do not continue with an unpersisted anonymous run.

### Required smoke-run record

A smoke-run record must contain:

- run ID
- profile
- fixture ID
- source/template repository
- release/tag and exact configuration SHA
- target project branch/worktree
- baseline HEAD
- started-at timestamp
- last-updated timestamp
- current stage
- current scenario
- total required scenario count loaded from `smoke/profiles.json`
- completed scenario count derived from persisted completed required scenario IDs
- completed scenarios
- pending scenarios
- skipped scenarios with reason
- current authoritative artifact paths
- current applicable verification/review/diagnosis/waiver evidence
- latest verification result, delivery gate, and freshness when available
- latest review result when available
- checkpoint notes
- model invocation ledger by model/workflow
- observed token/cost usage when available
- Claude invocation count and spend when available
- blockers / required user action
- defects
- final result

Do not rely on prior chat history to resume.

### New-run acknowledgement

Immediately after allocating the ID, report at minimum:

```text
Run ID: <run-id>
Profile: <FAST|FULL>
Fixture: <fixture-id>
Release: <tag>@<configuration-sha>
Current Stage: <stage>
Progress: <completed>/<required>
Claude Calls: 0
Next: <next stage/scenario>
```

Every later `/smoke` response for this run must repeat:

```text
Run ID: <run-id>
```

near the top.

### RESUME

For:

```text
/smoke RESUME <run-id>
```

reconstruct state from the exact run record and current repository evidence.

Before continuing:

- validate profile and fixture from the run record
- validate the target branch/worktree
- identify completed, pending, blocked, and invalidated scenarios
- re-evaluate whether the recorded next stage is still correct
- never trust chat history over repository state

Then continue from the earliest required incomplete/invalidated stage.

### STATUS

For:

```text
/smoke STATUS <run-id>
```

perform a read-only status operation.

Do not:

- mutate repository files
- inject failures
- execute lifecycle stages
- invoke child/subagent models
- alter the run record

Read the run record plus only the minimum repository evidence needed to detect obvious drift.

Return this fixed status shape:

```text
Smoke Run Status

Run ID: <run-id>
State: <IN_PROGRESS|WAITING_FOR_USER|BLOCKED|PASS|PASS_WITH_ENVIRONMENT_LIMITATION|FAIL>
Profile: <FAST|FULL>
Fixture: <fixture-id>
Release: <tag>@<configuration-sha>
Target: <branch/worktree>
Baseline HEAD: <sha>

Current Stage: <workflow-stage>
Current Scenario: <scenario-id-or-name>
Progress: <completed>/<required> required scenarios
Skipped: <count> (only policy-approved/optional scenarios)

Latest Verification:
- Result: <DONE|NOT_DONE|N/A>
- Delivery Gate: <CLEAR|BLOCKED|CLEAR_WITH_EXCEPTION|N/A>
- Freshness: <MATCH|MISMATCH|UNRECONSTRUCTABLE|N/A>

Latest Review: <APPROVE|REQUEST CHANGES|CHANGES_REQUIRED|NOT_RUN|N/A>

Model Ledger:
- GPT-5.6 Sol: <count>
- GPT-5.6 Luna: <count>
- DeepSeek Flash: <count>
- Claude: <count>

Observed Cost:
- DeepSeek: <value-or-UNAVAILABLE>
- Claude: <value-or-0/UNAVAILABLE>
- Other: <value-or-UNAVAILABLE>

Blocker / User Action: <none-or-exact-action>
Next: <next required stage/scenario-or-COMPLETE>
Last Updated: <timestamp>
```

If repository evidence shows that the recorded state has drifted, append:

```text
Drift Detected: YES
Required Action: /smoke RESUME <run-id>
```

Do not silently repair drift during `STATUS`.

### Missing/unusable run record

If a supplied run ID does not exist, is malformed, or cannot be reconstructed safely, return:

`SMOKE_RUN_UNRECONSTRUCTABLE`

## Stage 6 — Determine the correct entry point

Inspect persisted repository artifacts first.

Use the runbook's Start/Resume Decision Table and Artifact Invalidation Rules.

Do not blindly start from `/grill`.

For a brand-new FULL run, normally begin at `/grill`.

For a brand-new FAST run, prefer the earliest stage required by the FAST profile and selected fixture. Reuse valid planning artifacts from the template/project when available.

When prior valid artifacts exist:

- reuse them
- record them in the smoke-run file
- do not regenerate them merely to spend a model call

When upstream authority changed:

- mark invalidated downstream artifacts
- resume from the earliest invalidated authority stage

## Stage 7 — Execute underlying workflows with preserved model routing

The smoke orchestrator coordinates; it does not replace stage ownership.

### Planning stages

For:

- `/grill`
- `/prd`
- `/architect`
- `/spec`

delegate to `planning-worker` with the workflow's normal model and an explicit execution mode:

- `AUTHOR`
- `CONTINUE`
- `RECONCILE_ONLY`

For the default Stable-v0.1 smoke path, use GPT-5.6 Sol for these planning stages.

If the child returns `USER_INPUT_REQUIRED`:

- persist continuation state
- relay only the required question batch to the user
- return `SMOKE_USER_INPUT_REQUIRED`
- on the next `/smoke RESUME <run-id>`, delegate with `MODE: CONTINUE`

### Project initialization

Execute the `/project-init` contract using the orchestrator's GPT-5.6 Luna model.

### DeepSeek execution stages

Delegate to `smoke-executor` for exactly one of:

- `/implement`
- `/verify`
- `/fix`
- `/diagnose`

The executor must read and obey the corresponding command contract.

### Waiver

Execute the `/waive` contract using GPT-5.6 Luna.

Human risk acceptance can never be fabricated by the smoke orchestrator.

If explicit authorization is required:

- persist state
- return `SMOKE_USER_INPUT_REQUIRED`
- resume only after the user supplies/approves the required waiver details

### Review

Apply the normal `/review` contract.

Freshness must be validated before any reviewer invocation.

Use:

1. DeepSeek `pre-reviewer`
2. GPT-5.6 Sol `code-reviewer` only when pre-review returns `READY_FOR_SENIOR_REVIEW`

Negative freshness scenarios must invoke **zero reviewer models**.

### Adversarial review

Use the default DeepSeek `adversary`.

When material findings require planning correction:

- reconcile through `planning-worker`
- use `MODE: RECONCILE_ONLY`
- do not restart AUTHOR

Do not use Claude during smoke testing unless the user explicitly authorizes that isolated paid invocation.

## Stage 8 — Profile scenario selection

Load the selected profile definition from installed global `smoke/profiles.json`.

The profile registry is authoritative for:

- required scenario IDs
- optional scenario IDs
- denominator used by `Progress: <completed>/<required>`

Do not invent, renumber, or infer the required scenario count from prose.

Mark a required scenario complete only when its acceptance condition has actually been evidenced and persisted in the run record.

If a required scenario is skipped because of an allowed environment limitation, record it separately and use the profile's environment-limitation completion semantics; do not count it as silently completed.

### FAST

Run only the FAST_SMOKE scenarios defined by the runbook.

Default intent:

- static release/config checks
- project-init contract propagation when applicable
- first-spec uncommitted verification
- review-before-commit
- identical commit freshness
- content-mutation stale-evidence gate
- one direct `/fix → /verify` loop
- one fail-closed evidence scenario
- static model-routing checks

Skip diagnosis, waiver, adversarial runtime, repeated senior review, persistence-heavy integration, and paid Claude unless the changed framework area specifically requires them.

### FULL

Run the FULL_SMOKE scenarios defined by the runbook.

Start from the correct current stage and exercise all required acceptance criteria, including:

- full lifecycle authority
- fix
- diagnosis
- waiver
- review
- adversarial reconciliation
- arbitrary-stage resume
- upstream invalidation routing

## Stage 9 — Fixture budget enforcement

Treat the selected fixture's test budget as the default maximum application-test surface.

Do not add broad integration/E2E/load/soak suites merely for smoke realism.

If an underlying approved spec genuinely requires a check outside the fixture budget:

- the real workflow contract wins
- record why the budget was exceeded

Never mark a genuinely applicable required check `NOT_APPLICABLE` merely to save tokens.

## Stage 10 — Failure injection

Use only the failure recipes permitted by the selected fixture registry entry.

The Luna smoke orchestrator must not directly author implementation defects.

Delegate failure injection and any smoke-only fixture mutation to `smoke-executor` using:

```text
ACTION: INJECT_FAILURE
RECIPE: <registered-recipe-id>
```

Before injection:

- persist the clean checkpoint/state
- state the expected workflow route
- require the recipe ID to be listed in the selected fixture
- change only what is necessary for that scenario

Never use a security, auth, data-integrity, destructive, or vulnerability failure as the trivial waiver recipe.

After each scenario:

- restore/remediate through the workflow path being tested
- obtain fresh verification whenever implementation identity changed

## Stage 11 — Cost controls

Enforce the runbook's token/cost rules:

- one fixture per run
- minimal tests
- static checks instead of model calls where sufficient
- no regeneration of valid artifacts
- zero reviewer calls after freshness failure
- normally one successful senior review
- one bounded default adversarial challenge
- stop after two materially identical failed attempts
- Claude invocation count target: zero

Record every substantive model invocation in the run ledger.

## Stage 12 — Persist after every meaningful transition

Update the smoke-run record after:

- stage completion
- blocker
- user-input request
- failure injection
- verification result
- review result
- fix/diagnosis result
- waiver result
- checkpoint/restoration
- defect classification

This makes the smoke run restartable without chat history.

## Stage 13 — Completion

For FAST, finish with exactly one of:

- `FAST_SMOKE_PASS`
- `FAST_SMOKE_PASS_WITH_ENVIRONMENT_LIMITATION`
- `SMOKE_FAIL`

For FULL, finish with exactly one of:

- `FULL_SMOKE_PASS`
- `FULL_SMOKE_PASS_WITH_ENVIRONMENT_LIMITATION`
- `SMOKE_FAIL`

When paused rather than complete, use only:

- `SMOKE_FIXTURE_REQUIRED`
- `SMOKE_USER_INPUT_REQUIRED`
- `SMOKE_BLOCKED`
- `SMOKE_RUN_UNRECONSTRUCTABLE`

Never report PASS merely because only a subset of required scenarios executed.

## Output discipline

During execution, keep chat output concise.

Persist detailed evidence in the smoke-run record and normal workflow artifacts.

In chat report only:

- run ID, repeated near the top on every response
- profile + fixture
- stage/scenario just completed
- progress count
- PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED
- next stage
- material model/cost note
- required user action, if any
- final status token

Never make the user search prior chat history to discover the active Run ID.
